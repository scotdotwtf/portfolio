<br>This is definently a little simpler of a project than my other ones *lol* but I really enjoyed this. Pretty much I have this super good friend MAX and one time I was around her house and saw these beautiful flourencent lights. Most people probably would think they're gross and kinda ugly lights but I just love the artificial grungy look of them. So on a crazy rainy night I said screw it and we did an awesome quick photoshoot. I love the contrast of these photos and MAX obviously ate this up! ðŸ¤­ðŸ’œ 

<br>Note: If I had cinestill on me when we shot this I SOOO would have used it up- but hey, atleast these photos look good even for digital...
