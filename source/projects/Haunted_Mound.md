<br> So I kind-of like bootlegging things. Not to sell them or do anything illegal, haha. But seriously remaking things is truly the best way to practice design. When you have to remake something, you have to see what the original designer saw, imperfections and all. You have to replicate it. And making it physical is the cherry on top.

<br> This project came from a friend who told me about a limited Semetary cassette with only 20 copies ever made. I wanted to remake it for my friend as he's a big Semetary fan and it was great practice for going from digital to physical.
