<br> Okay I get it. ANOTHER bootleg isn't the best look haha! But seriously this was one of my first times making a custom vinyl album and it was really cool. So if you can suspend your want to arrest me for copyright infringement, let me explain why this rocks...

<br> Our story starts in december of 2024. At the time I pretty much just learned about one of Charli XCX's most infamous unreleased albums, XCX World. The first time I listened to this album it was seriously breathtaking. I don't wanna go too much into the album itself or the story but just know it's one of the coolest albums of all time. So with that I looked online for fan made XCX World vinyl just to see what people were making. I liked some of the stuff I saw but a lot of it just didn't fit the Charli look. My birthday was also just a month or two away so I thought it would be a fun birthday gift if I made this myself.

<br> To make an "official-feeling" Charli vinyl I had to first get high quality references. I went to look for vinyl made during this time and got some tasty results. While the Pop 2 vinyl hadn't gotten a stand-alone vinyl (it was bundled with Number 1 Angel) it still was a great starting point and was where I got insperation for the label of the vinyl. With those albums I was able to notice common things with Charli albums like how the barcodes were setup and also the copyright text and usual credits on albums. I also did some research for the fake copyright text and credits. Overall a lot of work into just getting the *official* details of this unofficial album.

<br> One of the things to really sell the feeling of it being a true Charli vinyl was making the actual vinyl jacket a gatefold jacket. If you don't know, a gatefold jacket is a special type of vinyl jacket that opens up like a book. Using some of the leaked photography I made the inner gatefold part of the jacket use the "Wall Street Princess" photoshoot of Charli since it has a great wide photo that truly opens up like a book.

<br> Finally to finish off this concept I decided to add an actual barcode that linked to the discogs release of XCX World. This not only acted as a super fun party trick to show my friends but also complete the "official" feeling of the album. Everything, even down to the very font, was purposefully done to replicate the feeling of getting vinyl by Charli. This project was FUN and I totally will be looking to do another one like it.
