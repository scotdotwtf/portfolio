# Story

While this is less of a project and more of an entire collection of projects, I think it still deserves to be up here haha. All of these projects were done for my friends who have made a little group that we call the "GEE CEE." It's not like we're actually getting payed for anything we do, nor is any of this official- it's ROBLOX for gods sake (lol)- but seriously we've made some cool shit.

<br> One of our first "official-ish" projects we've done is on a little project called "GEE CEE HUB." This is a small interface for running our custom scripts. To set the scene, ROBLOX had pretty much made it almost impossible to make scriptst that allowed your character to dance or have fun animations. But one of our friends in the group, Bug, created a game that showed every single official ROBLOX animation that you could use without ROBLOX stopping you.

With this game that our friend made, we were able to create custom scripts that replicated animation scripts of the past but using ROBLOX-published animations. It was pretty janky but still cool, and with those scripts we created a little hub for it.

<br> While GEE CEE HUB is still in kind-of active development, we've focused more on our VR version of it. I also did the user interface design and a little bit of the programming for that too. Our main goal was to replicate the look and feeling of old iOS with ROBLOX's GUI system.

Another challenge for this was that we were also making this work on our little hobbled-together executor: JINX7.

<br> JINX7 and our little executor projects have all been in lots of development. While I wouldn't say were done with either, we've made great progress and huge new developments on weird awesome things you can do when you have your own executor. Shown has made lots of progress for the backend side of this but this project was orignally based on another members work, Caet. He initially made caetsploit which morphed into JINX. I've done the UI for both JINX7 and JINX8. Both are based on the classic executor "RC7" with JINX7 being a full scale recreation of it in PyQt.
