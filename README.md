### https://scot.wtf/
this is my portfolio. it's static html css and js although im using mustache js to make template menus with items and loading json to do that. check out https://scot.wtf/#socials and https://scot.wtf/#downloadables to see how i did that, or just visit the website and click on the green @ or 'downloadables' at the top. i did use tailwind's cdn for css although i will be looking for alternative ways to use tailwind in github pages.
