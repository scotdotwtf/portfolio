# portfolio
### https://scot.wtf/
this is my portfolio. it's written in nunjucks for 11ty along with some other funnies like using mustache.js for templating so i could pull from external sources. i also used tailwind because it ginuenly made it so much easier to write css. while it's not perfect, it's a pretty okay template and attempt at making an artistic portfolio while keeping it static. this project is free to use, share, and modify! :>

also yes i know i'm using 2 templating frameworks at once. there was a reason. ðŸ’€

## systems
- 11ty (templating)
